    "summary": "MTV SPORTS: Skateboarding Featuring Andy Macdonald puts the excitement of performing a 360-kickflip in the palm of your hand. Choose from four different skaters, including Andy Macdonald himself. Get used to the board and the controls with the Free Ride mode and, when you are ready for some action, try to meet the quotas for each of the 18 stages in the game. Some require that you earn a set amount of points, which you do by collecting the MTV icons, which are spread throughout the arena. To collect each one, you must perform a different trick. Other stages have more demanding quotas including navigating an obstacle course, collecting balloons, and crashing through items. Now you can skateboard anywhere with MTV SPORTS: Skateboarding Featuring Andy Macdonald."
